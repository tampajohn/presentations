- CTO at Bringhub
: a "native commerce" company spread between Los Angeles, New York, and DTSP. (CTO)
- Husband of a wonderfully understanding wife and father of three amazing boys
: best thing to happen to me
- Lover of data
: Data shouldn't have to be sampled, and why is your DB so big???!
- Hater of PHP
: Who doesn't hate PHP... I mean seriously

* Obligatory Golang Plug
The right language to use... pretty much always

: We're huge fans of Golang at Bringhub.  When taking a look at various analytics vendors, we loved seeing first class support for Golang from our friends at snowflake

* Syslog -> SQL
A simple solution, and a great place to start.

* But it wasn't perfect

- Log rotation crapping out ... oops
- Fluentd memory usage ... yikes
- SQL cluster ... $$$
- Throughput under scale was an issue


* DynamoDB -> Lambda -> Mongo -> Custom Dashboard
A better solution for us... it allowed us to partition our data dynamically, and really scaled with our needs.

* But... it wasn't perfect
- Mongo Cluster for raw data ... $$$$$$$$$
- Lambda debugging ... meh
- Custom pipelines are expensive in engineering resources

* Docker Cloud Hosted Go API -> Postgres
Since we were finally able to cast off the shackles of our oppressors (PHP), and had decided a containerized Go based environment was the ultimate solution to our stack... we naturally wanted to write our analytics there.
